function sol = gsp_classification_knn(G ,M, y )
%GSP_CLASSIFICATION_KNN Classification using knn
%   Usage: sol = gsp_classification_knn(G ,M, y );
%
%   Input parameters:
%       G   : Graph
%       M   : Mask (to determine with label is known)
%       y   : label (total size of the problem)
%
%   Output parameters:
%       sol : Solution of the problem
%
%   Warning: In order to use this function, you have to use a special
%   graph. This graph can be computed with the function:
%   GSP_KNN_CLASSIFY_GRAPH .
